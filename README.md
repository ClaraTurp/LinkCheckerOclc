# LinkCheckerOclc

The following code queries OCLC's Knowledge Base API for a particular collection (using the collection ID) and sends a report (Kbart as attachment) by email of all the broken links.
This code has been designed to check Open Access collections.

It is meant to be programmed to run once a month (I used task scheduler)
